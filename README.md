# Let's host this app!

### Prerequisites:
- Have your front-end and backend on separate GitHub Repos (given you have a backend)
- We'll be using **Heroku** to host our rails app! So consider signing up for an account first.
- **IMPORTANT:**
  - Make sure that your Rails API App is using `postgresql` as database adapter. Heroku doesn't support `sqlite3` which is rails's default.
  - If you're just getting started, you can use `rails new <app_name> --api --database=postgresql` which will scaffold the app accordingly.
  - If you've already worked on the application, you can goto `/config/database.yml` and change the configuration to use `postgresql`.
